# Spotifystatistics

Statisfy is an Android application showing Spotify statistics (almost). Super cool!

The application is made for spotify users to be able to get their own top artist, songs and genres that has been played during long, medium or short term periods. The application is however only in making, the first version is only a test using placeholders taken from premade users.


## For developers


This application is made with android studios that is connecting to a localhost servlet. The application takes premade users and their music information to make toplists in the three different tabs - artist, songs and genres.
